## Prompts Used

Help me create a to-do chrome browser extension. Add, edit and archive entries. Archived items can be viewed on a separate tab and exported to a CSV. Active tasks can also be exported to CSV. Archived tasks can be restored and made active again. Archived items can be deleted.

Help me create an external express/node server that saves/syncs user todo items when the user is online. I'd like a way to sync all of the data input with an external server. I want this to be done asynchronously, so that if the user is offline, local storage is used. Then, when the user is back online, the local storage will sync with the external server.

In addition, instruct me on how to build and deploy the external server with MongoDB that stores the synced data. When designing this server, consider the ability to pull and sync data from a future mobile app as well. Ultimately, we will want a REST API to support a central web app, browser extension and mobile app syncing all user to do items across all apps.
